# Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 1

I was bored while watching my uni class of 3D Graphics Programming and decided to spin it up a little and started reading the _fantastic_ book [Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0985811749/) by [Eric Lengyel](https://twitter.com/EricLengyel). Just looking at the examples was great, so I decided to do the exercises and examples in the book using "my own style" and lot less knowledge of C++ :)

These are my attempts.
